		<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<div class="description">
			<p>For the impact projects I am involved in, I often create websites to better showcase our work and reach a larger audience. Initially using web builders such as Weebly, I now readily write HTML/CSS in order to create customized site features.</p>
			<p>Currently, I am learning Python and Django for building back-end.</p>

				<p>Changenuity is a startup I co-founded; it is a web platform that connects impact-seeking people with impact-creating opportunities.</p>
				<p>Using Weebly's site builder, I produced the bulk of our pages and their layouts, adding customized CSS styling where appropriate. I also edited our meta tags in order to modify our website's preview on Facebook. 
				<p>Our design philosophy for the website is to design a a clean, attractive, and easily-understood interface. We were able to validate this during our MVP (minimum viable product) launch period, in which time we reached over 2000 visitors per week </p>
				<p>I am currently learning Python and Django to build a user system for Changenuity.</p>

				<strong>Online Technical Portfolio</strong>
				<p>This online portfolio was coded from scratch. Usually I use an existing website theme as a skeleton, but this time I decided to build a website using what I have seen and learned. I continually add and change website elements in order to improve the site.</p>

				<strong>North Surrey Model United Nations</strong>
				<p>Pictured is a website I designed with a friend for a Model United Nations (MUN) conference that I organized.</p>
				<p>At the time, we used only Weebly's site builder, and not any HTML/CSS. Building the website was therefore a pure design task. I learned how to use colour schemes and page layouts in order to communicate information in a way that was both clear and aesthetically-pleasing.</p>


				<p>As for a fun fact: our conference donated its profits to the United Nations itself, something that had not been done before!</p>

				<strong>Miscellaneous Mockups</strong>
				<p>Using site builders such as Weebly and Strikingly, I often prototype websites to visualize ideas and play with them. This helps me gain a better sense of whether I should pursue an idea as a project or not, and also hones my website aesthetic design skills.</p>

			<p>Left: Cardstock Prototype. Right: Cardboard Prototype</p>
			</p>After creating a number of cardstock prototypes, we realized that our backrest was particularly weak. With our first major design upgrade, we added back supports to our chair. However, our tests demonstrated two problems:</p>
			<p>1. The back supports were easily damaged or dislocated, since they had low thickness.</p>
			<p>2. Sitting in the chair for more than an hour would produce pain in the buttocks.</p>
