		<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<div class="description">
			<p>Over the past year, I worked with a post-doctorate mentor to learn how to model superconductor systems using a Python software package named Kwant. Our aim is to study a particular behaviour of superconductors called topology, which, if exploited, can lead to error-free quantum computing.</p>
			<p>Translating physical equations into code was especially challenging at the beginning, as both the physics and the coding language were new to me, but through persistence and resourceful learning I was able to develop a foundational understanding of the field.</p>

				<strong>Lattice Plot, 1D Josephson Junction</strong>
				<p>A Josephson Junction consists of a semiconductor sandwiched between two superconductors. Under certain circumstances, it exhibits topological behaviour -- the goal is to find determine what these circumstances are.</p>
				<p>To prepare the system for computation, I initialized each point of the lattice with the system's Hamiltonian. Pictured is a plot of a lattice that is 10 atoms long, with superconducting leads attached on either side.</p>

				<p>Currently, I am modelling a 2D semiconductor in preparation to compute the phase diagram of a 2D Josephson Junction. Our goal is to derive the latter's phase boundary conditions.</p>
