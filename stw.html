		<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<div class="description">
			<p>I am currently working with two friends to develop a portable cardboard chair for schoolchildren in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Originally a class project, we later decided to make a product that could help real people. Our goal is to maximize durability and comfort while minimizing weight and cost.</p>
			<p>Although I am involved in all parts of the project, my particular focus has been using AutoCAD to draw formal layouts for prototyping. From a non-technical standpoint, this project has also been a great opportunity to learn stakeholder management; in order to ensure we are meeting the needs of our end users, we neeed to clearly communicate our progress and solicit feedback.<p>

	    		<strong>STW 1.0</strong>
				</p>This is the original design from our class project, which received the highest score among ~150 teams of students.</p>
				<strong>Specifications:</strong>
				<p>- Supports over 300kg, tested with sandbags</p>
				<p>- Uses 30ft^2 of cardboard, weighing less than 1kg</p>
				<p>- Fully assemblable and disassemblable; no adhesives used.</p>

				<strong>STW 2.1.1 AutoCAD Drawing</strong>
				</p>With our first major design upgrade, we improved the back support. Pictured is my take on the problem, which was to add horizontal rails slotted through the stiles of the chair.</p>
				<p>Cardstock prototypes verified that this was feasible, but not the best solution the backrest would still warp to some extent.</p>

				<strong>STW 2.1.2 Test </strong>
				<p>We decided to build a full-scale prototype of a riskier design, suggested by a team member.</p> 

				<p>Design philosophy: use vertical rails to provide both back support and a comfortable slant to rest on.</p>
				<p>However, our tests demonstrated two problems:</p>
				<p>1. The back supports were easily damaged or dislocated, since they had low thickness.</p>
				<p>2. Sitting in the chair for more than an hour would produce pain in the buttocks.</p>
				<strong>As pictured, the bottoms of the vertical rails were crumpled after a load was applied.</strong>

				<strong>STW 2.2.1 AutoCAD Drawing </strong>
				<p>Design philosophy:</p>
				<p>1. Create a lattice base to distribute a person's load when sitting on our chair.</p>
				<p>2. Shortened the backrest to see if it would be sturdier.</p>
				<p>3. As a team, we also decided to try prototyping a small desk -- essentially, STW 1.0 without a backrest.</p>
				<p>Pictured is a drawing I drafted for this design. Although the cardstock prototype for this design showed promise, it featured too many different parts. This could make it overly complicated for our end-users to assemble and disassemble.</p>

				<strong>STW 2.3 AutoCAD Drawing</strong>
				<p>One of our team mates pitched a design that addressed our previous two problems: a weak back and uncomfortable seat. Pictured is my AutoCAD drawing, which has been used for laser cutting prototypes.</p>
				<p>Not only that, but the design is also quite simple to build and assemble: it only features 3 unique parts! It is interesting to note how our design has become progressively simpler through iterations.</p>

				<p>Design philosophy:</p>
				<p>1. Fold triangular prisms to serve as cushions and supports.</p>

				<strong>STW 2.3 Beta Prototype</strong>
				<p>Pictured is our final chair design, built by hand. </p>
				<p>Since shipping the chairs abroad is expensive, we are laser cutting stencils so that our end-users can build more chairs for themselves on-site.</p>
