		<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<div class="description">
			<p>I am currently working with two friends to develop a portable, cost-efficient cardboard chair for schoolchildren at a learning centre in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Originally a class project, we later decided to make a product that could help real people. Our goal is to maximize durability and comfort while minimizing the weight and materials cost of the chair.</p>
			<p>From a non-technical standpoint, this project has been a great opportunity to learn stakeholder management; in order to ensure we are meeting the needs of our end users, we neeed to clearly communicate our progress and solicit feedback.<p>

				<strong>STW 2.1.1 AutoCAD Drawing (Drafter: Myself)</strong>
				</p>With our first major design upgrade, we improved the back support. My take on the problem was to add horizontal rails, slotted through the stiles of the chair.</p>
				<p>Cardstock prototypes verified that this was feasible, but not the best solution the backrest would still warp to some extent.</p>

				<strong>STW 2.1.2 Test </strong>
				<p>We decided to build a full-scale prototype of a riskier design, suggested by a team member. 

				<p>Design philosophy: use vertical rails to provide both back support and a comfortable slant to rest on.</p>
				<p>However, our tests demonstrated two problems:</p>
				<p>1. The back supports were easily damaged or dislocated, since they had low thickness.</p>
				<p>2. Sitting in the chair for more than an hour would produce pain in the buttocks.</p>
				<strong>As pictured, the bottoms of the vertical rails were crumpled after a load was applied.</strong>

				<strong>STW 2.2.1 AutoCAD Drawing (Drafter: Myself) </strong>
				<p>Design philosophy:</p>
				<p>1. Create a lattice base to distribute a person's load when sitting on our chair.</p>
				<p>2. Shortened the backrest to see if it would be sturdier.</p>
				<p>3. As a team, we also decided to try prototyping a small desk -- essentially, STW 1.0 without a backrest.
				<p>Although the cardstock prototype for this design showed promise, it featured too many different parts. This could make it complicated for our end-users to assemble and disassemble.

				<strong>STW 2.3 AutoCAD Drawing (Drafter: Myself)</strong>
				<p>One of our team mates was able to pitch a design that addressed all of our previous two problems: a sturdy back, comfortable seat.
				<p>Not only that, but the design is also quite simple to build and assemble: it only features 3 unique parts! It is interesting to note how our design has become progressively simpler through iterations.</p>

				<p>Design philosophy:</p>
				<p>1. Fold triangular prisms to serve as cushions and supports.</p>

				<strong>STW 2.3 Beta Prototype</strong>
				<p>Pictured is our final chair design, built by hand. </p>
				<p>Since shipping the chairs abroad is expensive, we intend to laser cut stencils so that our end-users can build more chairs for themselves on-site.</p>
				<p>We plan to send the first five chairs to our partner learning centre by Sept. 30.</p>
