                  From Jan - Apr 2017 I worked as an engineering intern at TRIUMF,
                  Canada's national nuclear and particle physics laboratory.
                  I built electromagnetic simulations for the particle accelerator team
                  and assisted maintenance and installation of the accelerators.

                    I used COMSOL Multiphysics (AC/DC Module) to optimize the magnetic fields of a custom electromagnet
                    for the &beta;-NQR materials science spectrometer. I wrote MATLAB scripts to
                    confirm the results from COMSOL.

                    Specifically, my role was to optimize the dimensions of the magnet such that the magnetic fields at the centre of the magnet
                    met design requirements. I also checked error cases to ensure the magnet design could tolerate assembly error.

                    This project was relatively open-ended, as there were many different possibile designs. I learned the importance of
                    simplifying large problems into small models that can be economically solved - instead of using full 3D models,
                    for example, I used an axisymmetric slice with a fine mesh only in critical areas.

                    <br>I also wrote a <a href="http://bit.ly/2oU4vfV" target="_blank">simulation manual</a> to help team members learn how to use
                    and modify my simulation.

                    Using COMSOL (RF Module), I investigated the inexplicable cause of quality factor decrease
                    in a superconducting accelerator. My study was inconclusive, but helped eliminate
                    possible causes of the problem. <br><br>
                    Results from my study were presented at the TESLA Technology Collaboration's 2017 annual meeting,
                    as the problem has been experienced at other labs around the world.

                    Residual-Resistivity Ratio (RRR) measurement:<br> RRR measurement is used to determine
                    the purity grade of a metal. We measured the purity of niobium superconductor samples
                    by measuring the material's electrical resistance above and below 9.6 K.
