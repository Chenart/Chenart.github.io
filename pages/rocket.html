                  I worked in a team to build the Electromechanical Experimental
                  Control System (EMECS). Our goal was to create a system that
                  would stabilize a rocket payload during launch, as large accelerations
                  and vibrations can damage delicate payloads.

                  <br><br>
                  After a number of failed designs, we found success using
                  electrorheological (ER) fluid as our stabilizing mechanism.
                  ER fluid changes viscosity based on applied voltage, allowing
                  us to actively control the amount by which it dampens movement.

                        Our final system is in the photo below.
                        It consists of a main chamber, which is where we would put an object
                        that would be transported to space. For our demonstration system, we used
                        the cylindrical steel mass shown as a "dummy payload". The mass flots
                        on top of the ER fluid.
                        <br><br>
                        The side chambers contain ER fluid and have conducting walls,
                        to which we apply a voltage (applied via the attached leads shown)
                        to control the ER fluid.
                        <br><br>
                        Below: the physical system. Scroll down for an explanation of the mechanism.
                        <img src="../images/emecs-final.jpg">
                        The damping mechanism is an idea I thought of after reading
                        research literature on ER fluid stabilizer systems. In this
                        design, the object we would like to stabilize floats on top of
                        ER fluid (we separate the two with a piston cap) in a main chamber.
                        Side chambers with conducting walls allow the ER fluid to be
                        displaced from the main chamber.
                        <br><br>
                        In simplest terms, our stabilizing mechanism works like this:
                        <ol>
                          <li> Acceleration causes the object to move downwards in the
                            main chamber, causing fluid in the side chambers to displace up.
                          <li> As this happens, we apply a voltage (200+ V) across the parallel plates to create
                            regions of high viscosity in the ER fluid.
                          <li> This impedes the fluid's ability to displace up the side chambers,
                            causing the object's downward movement to be impeded. We thus achieve damping.
                        </ol>

                        A sketch of our system:
                        <img src="../images/erf-sketch.jpg">

                        Note also that our system is only designed to damp downwards movements,
                        which are the principal movements during rocket launch. Our system is not
                        designed to handle damping in cases where the payload is ejected from
                        rocket or experiences large decelerations when a parachute is deployed.

                    My main role involved validating our design's ability to control
                    ER fluid. This ability depends on a large number of factors, including
                    fluid properties, applied voltage, distance between parallel plates, and area
                    of application. As a result, I devised a number of tests, experiment jigs, and
                    low-fidelity prototypes.

                    Notable work:
                    <ul>
                      <li> Used Autodesk Inventor to model and 3D print a Ford viscosity testing cup because
                           ordering one was too expensive. I found the required dimensions online.</li>
                      <li> Devised experiments and built jigs to characterize viscosity and voltage response of
                           different ER fluids, and find the best fluid to use.</li>
                      <li> Used the tests to define voltage and mechanical requirements for the final system.</li>
                      <li> Built mechanical system prototypes (machining and hand tools, soldering)</li>
                      <li> Researching literature to understand ER fluid.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Below: A test jig I assembled for an experiment. The orange object is the
                    Ford cup I designed. We would measure the time it takes for a specific
                    ER fluid to drain. I also made the ER fluid: in our case, I used starch mixed
                    in silicone oil, and conducted tests to find the best mixture ratio.

                    Below: A late-stage prototype I helped build. My team mate modelled and 3D printed
                    the white plastic body. I made and installed the parallel plates and soldered on the wires.
                    We found that the wires would not adhere to the copper plates well, so we later used epoxy
                    to secure them. <!-- check -->

                    Another problem for us was power source. We had enough space to generate
                    roughly 200 V, but for our system to work properly we needed at least 700-800 V.

                    I suggested us buying or making a voltage multiplier.
