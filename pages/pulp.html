                  [pulp] is a social enterprise that designs and builds
                  school chairs out of upcycled cardboard for low-resource classrooms
                  around the world.

                  We had a partnership with the You Have It In You Foundation to
                  build our chairs according to their needs. They run a learning centre
                  in Zimbabwe for students from low-income families.

                    I used COMSOL Multiphysics (AC/DC Module) to optimize the magnetic fields of a custom electromagnet
                    for the &beta;-NQR materials science spectrometer. I wrote MATLAB scripts todo
                    confirm the results from COMSOL.

                    Using COMSOL (RF Module), I investigated the inexplicable cause of quality factor decrease
                    in a superconducting accelerator. My study was inconclusive, but helped eliminate some
                    possible causes of the problem. <br><br>
                    Results from my study were presented at the TTC 2017 workshop, as the problem has been
                    experienced at other labs around the world.
