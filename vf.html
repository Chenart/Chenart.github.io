	<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<div class="description">
			<p>This was a pilot project where I explored how to develop a powerless vertical farming (VF) unit. The goal was to alleviate rural poverty in developing countries.</p>
			<p>Combining simulations with literature research, I presented a feasibility study at the 2016 Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC).</p>
			
		<h2>The Result</h2>
			<p>Powerless vertical farms show technical promise, but would have difficulty being adopted by their intended users. Policy and market dynamics are larger influences than technology on poverty.

			<p>Until socio-economic conditions improve, these farms would be a major investment risk for adopters.</p>
