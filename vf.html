		<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<div class="description">
			<p>For this project, I explored how to develop a powerless vertical farming (VF) unit. The goal was to alleviate rural poverty in developing countries.</p>
			<p>Interestingly, the existing literature only studies industrial VF systems, which are exorbitantly expensive and energy-intensive. Exploring powerless systems, and for rural applications, was therefore a pilot initiative.
			<p>Combining some basic simulations with the results of my literature research, I produced a feasibility study which I presented as a poster at the 2016 Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC).</p>
			<br>
		<h2>The Result</h2>
			<p>Through my research, I concluded that the vertical farms showed technical promise, but would have difficulty being adopted by their intended users. Policy and market dynamics, rather than technology, are the largest influences on rural and urban poverty. Until these vertical farms are able to overcome these socio-economic barriers, they post a rather significant investment risk to potential adopters.</p>
