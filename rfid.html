		<h2>Project Summary</h2>
		<div class="description">
			<p>Inspired by the long, uncertainty-filled wait at airport luggage claim areas, I worked with a friend to design an RFID tag that would notify airport patrons when their bags arrived on the carousel.</p>
			<p>After conducting literature research, we used an Arduino kit to attempt to build a system with a 2 ft sensing range. Although we achieved desired results at 5cm, we terminated the project before we could design a better system, as we could not persuade ourselves that it provided enough benefit that airports and consumers would use it.</p>

				<p>This photo shows the concept that we had in mind for our luggage tag. We envisioned a card with RFID inlays that could be attached to bags at the handle.

				<strong>Prototyping</strong>
				<p><strong>Background:</strong> Attached to the breadboard is an RFID reader we purchased, with which we are using to decode signals from RFID tags.</p>
				<p><strong>Foreground:</strong> In our attempt to build a longer range RFID sensor, we formed a coil of magnet wire that we connected via alligator clips to the RFID reader. In the photo, I am compressing the coil to increase field density.</p>

				<p>Our prototyping work was veritably "bootstrapping"; we used whatever objects that were available to us and tried to transform them into functional components of our device. For our coil experimentation, this entailed using glass bottles and even steel chair legs as cores.
				<p>Despite the creativity involved in "bootstrapping", I learned that the development of a succcessful prototype still requires proper engineering tools and processes. We had eschewed the latter in favour of cost, but I now understand that the cost can be a worthwhile investment.</p>
